The 2015 Dublin dataset used in the case study is publicly available  (Laefer et al. 2017). The source files used are the 3D point-cloud (LAZ) as input data and the accompanying aerial photos for ground truthing. Over 1.4 billion laser points were collected, including partially covered areas, over an area of more than 2kmÂ² in Dublin, Ireland.
